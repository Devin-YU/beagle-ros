Reports of the Beagle-ROS project:
====================================
====================================

Week 1:
=======
What has been accomplished?:
    - Angstrom distribution running in the BB
    - ROS running installed in Angstrom through the script https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros/blob/master/ros-angstrom.sh
    - roscore running
    - ros installation working against an external master (rosnode list and rosnode ping)

 Issues:
    - It seems ROS nodes doesn't start properly. This is an issue previosly opened in the meta-ros project https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros/issues/68. I'm actively working to find a solution with the meta-ros guys https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros/issues/10  but it might take a while since this issue has been open for some time already.
    - catkin_make doesn't work. Neither it does going through the process manually http://www.ros.org/wiki/catkin/commands/catkin_make.

 Plans for the next week:
    - Adress the first issue. Try to make the ROS nodes start properly. Some debugging will be necessary.
    - Address catkin_make issue.
    - complete the rosping milestone
    - keep working in the roadmap planned (ROS tutorials for now).

    

Week 2:
=======
What has been accomplished?:
    - Several tests with ROS nodes and ping. It seems the nodes launched from external cores work fine while the nodes launched from the BeagleBone (Angstrom, meta-ros) don't seem to work. See issue #10 at the meta-ros code (https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros/issues/10)
    - python-catkin updated. Due to this update there's some progress in the catkin_make process
    - started debugging the ros nodes

 Issues:
    - ROS nodes still doesn't work as expected. See the debug logs at #10.
    - catkin_make doesn't fully work in Angstrom. See #99 (https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros/issues/99).

 Plans for the next week:
    - Address catkin_make issue.
    - Keep debugging the nodes.
    - keep working in the roadmap planned (ROS tutorials for now).

    

Week 3:
=======
What has been accomplished?:
    - ROS nodes now work properly if launched from the bone. ROS ping works from every every node now.
    - catkin_make issue solved.
    - Progress with tutorials.

 Issues:
    - rospack depends1 not working (meta-ros issue #108). For now this task will be left for a latter time.
    - building ROS packages in the bone using catkin_make (meta-ros issue #109). Like the previous one, it requires too much work for now. 

 Plans for the next week:
    - Since building the ROS packages natively with catkin_make might lead to a route that could take several weeks to complete, this task will be done
        using the cross-compiler. A tutorial will be created for this purpose.
    - Continue with ROS tutorials.
