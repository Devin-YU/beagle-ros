Here you can find all the packages necessary to install ROS in the BeagleBone in a system running **Angstrom** through meta-ros version 0.1.

-----------------

It might be wise to install everything from the Angstrom feed instead. `opkg install <package-name>` will do that. 

This directory provides only packages for a ROS hydro **working** version but it could be outdated.
