Both ROS and the BeagleBone are great tools and increasingly being used in robotics. Having both of them working together in a easy way would be a great asset. \r\n\r\nA lot of users show their interest for ARM ROS integration. Some made a couple of tutorials about how to install ROS on Ubuntu on the BeagleBoard however this documentation is getting a bit old fashioned and probably not the right way. There's also some code to use lightweight versions of ROS but again, roboticists might not be looking for a light-ROS device but a fully functional one.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIt's highly recommended to have the last version of Angstrom.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\n##Description of the files:\r\n\r\n* **LICENSE**: License of the code.\r\n\r\n* **README.md**: This document.\r\n\r\n* **scripts**: Scripts to automate processes.\r\n\r\n* **docs**: Documentation.\r\n\r\n* **lib**: Libraries used.\r\n\r\n* **recipes-ros**: OpenEmbedded recipes. These recipes should be used with the meta-ros code.\r\n\r\n* **conf**: OpenEmbedded configuration directory. This directory is added so that the beagle-ros project can be directly added as a layer in Angstrom/OpenEmbedded systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis layer depends on:\r\n\r\n    URI: https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros\r\n    branch: master\r\n    revision: HEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nUSAGE\r\n=====\r\n##Getting roscore running\r\n\r\n* Get an Angstrom distribution following http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/building-angstrom.\r\n\r\n* Put the MLO, u-boot and FS in the SD card as explained in http://downloads.angstrom-distribution.org/demo/beaglebone/.\r\n\r\n* Update the Angstrom feed through `opkg update`.\r\n\r\n* Install git using `opkg install git`.\r\n\r\n* Get the **beagle-ros** code: `git clone git://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros.git`.\r\n\r\n* Install all the packages for ROS in Angstrom (30 minutes):\r\n ```\r\n cd beagle-ros/scripts\r\n source minimal-ros-install-angstrom.sh\r\n ```\r\n\r\n* ~~source `/usr/setup.bash`. Updates in the ROS recipes doesn't install scripts in the `/usr/` directory anymore. To configure the enviroment properly check this [bashrc](https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros/blob/master/scripts/bashrc) file.~~\r\n\r\n* run `roscore`.\r\n    \r\n##First steps\r\nGetting started with Angstrom (or OpenEmbedded) and bitbake might be a bit tough at the beggining but it gets better and after a while you will love it, promised ;). First, take a look at the [FAQ](https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros/wiki/FAQ).\r\n\r\nBeagle-ROS makes use of the meta-ros project, an OpenEmbedded layer that provides ROS to embedded devices. In order to get comfortable with meta-ros the [diving-meta-ros](https://github.com/vmayoral/diving-meta-ros) repo aims to give you some aid with the first steps (take into account that this tutorial assumes that you are already comfortable with ROS. If not take a look at their [tutorials](http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials)).\r\n    \r\n##Installing the recipes\r\nThe easiest way to install the bitbake recipes provided is to `git clone` the beagle-ros code directly into the Angstrom `sources/` directory and add the beagle-ros as a layer:\r\n* Edit `conf/bblayers.conf`\r\n* add `${TOPDIR}/sources/beagle-ros \\` to the `BASELAYERS` variable\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to add the recipes inside of the meta-ros code. There're instructions in https://github.com/vmayoral/beginner_tutorials/blob/master/README.md of how to put these recipes in the meta-ros file structure. ([Here](https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros/tree/master/recipes-ros) you can see the recipes available).\r\n\r\n##Cross-compiling the recipes\r\nFrom the `TOPDIR` of Angstrom run `bitbake <recipe-name>`. \r\n    For example: `bitbake beginner-tutorials`\r\n\r\n(Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros/wiki/FAQ#is-it-possible-to-cross-compile-ros-for-other-arm-processors) if you wish to cross-compile all the neccessary recipes to have ROS in your machine.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBeagleBone ROS Packages\r\n==================\r\nSome ROS Packages designed for the BeagleBone:\r\n\r\n* [bb_sharp_ir](https://github.com/vmayoral/bb_sharp_ir): BeagleBone Shark IR sensors ROS Package.\r\n* [bb_dc_motors](https://github.com/vmayoral/bb_dc_motors): ROS package that launches a node to control a DC motor connected to the BeagleBone.\r\n* [bb_mpu9150](https://github.com/vmayoral/bb_mpu9150): BeagleBone ROS package that publishes the Invensense MPU-9150 data into a Topic.\r\n* [bb_altimeter](https://github.com/vmayoral/bb_altimeter): ROS package for the BeagleBone that publishes the altimeter MPL3115A2 values to a Topic.\r\n\r\n(recipes to cross-compile these packages are available at the `recipes-ros` folder)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
