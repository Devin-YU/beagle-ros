Recipes:
==================

The following directories contain bitbake recipes for cross-compiling different ROS packages.

##Recipes list:

* **beginner-tutorials**: A simple talker/listerner ROS package written in python. ([code](https://github.com/vmayoral/beginner_tutorials), [docs](https://github.com/vmayoral/beginner_tutorials/blob/master/README.md))

* **ros-tutorials**: This package attempts to show the features of ROS step-by-step, including using messages, servers, parameters, etc. ([code](https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials), [docs](http://ros.org/wiki/ros_tutorials))

* **common-tutorials**: common_tutorials: actionlib_tutorials | nodelet_tutorial_math | pluginlib_tutorials | turtle_actionlib. ([code](https://github.com/ros/common_tutorials), [docs](http://www.ros.org/wiki/common_tutorials))

* **linux-mpu9150**: recipe to cross-compile the Invensense MPU-9150 driver. ([code](https://github.com/Pansenti/linux-mpu9150))

* **bb-mpu9150**: recipe to cross-compile a ROS package that publishes the Invensense MPU-9150 data into a ROS Topic. ([code](https://github.com/vmayoral/bb_mpu9150))

* **bb-dc-motors**: recipe to cross-compile a ROS package that activates a DC motor on the BB using the adafruit's library. ([code](https://github.com/vmayoral/bb_dc_motors))

* **bb-sharp-IR**: recipe to cross-compile a ROS package that created a node that harvest the data from the Sharp IR GP2Y0A21YK0F sensor and publishes it to a topic. ([code](https://github.com/vmayoral/bb_sharp_IR))

* **ros-mpu9150**: recipe to cross-compile a ROS package that publishes the Invensense MPU-9150 data into a ROS Topic. ([code](https://github.com/vmayoral/ros-mpu9150))

* **ros-bb-dc-motors**: recipe to cross-compile a ROS package that activates a DC motor on the BB using the adafruit's library. ([code](https://github.com/vmayoral/ros_bb_dc_motors))

##Installing the recipes
The easiest way to install the recipes is to `git clone` the beagle-ros code directly into the Angstrom `sources/` directory and add the beagle-ros as a layer:
* Edit `conf/bblayers.conf`
* add `${TOPDIR}/sources/beagle-ros \` to the `BASELAYERS` variable

It's also possible to add the recipes inside of the meta-ros code. There're instructions in https://github.com/vmayoral/beginner_tutorials/blob/master/README.md of how to put these recipes in the meta-ros file structure.

##Cross-compiling the recipes
From the `TOPDIR` of Angstrom run `bitbake <recipe-name>`. For example:
* `bitbake beginner-tutorials`
* `bitbake roscpp-tutorials`
