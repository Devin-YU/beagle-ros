This recipe cross-compiles the linux-mpu9150 driver. Modifications should be made to the CMakeLists.txt source code
if you desire to install the cross-compiled files in a specific way. Check the [source code](https://github.com/Pansenti/linux-mpu9150)

    The recipe although compiles doesn't ship anything. Try the cross-compiling or native method explained in the source code.
