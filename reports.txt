Reports of the Beagle-ROS project:
====================================
====================================

Week 1:
=======
What has been accomplished?:
    - Angstrom distribution running in the BB
    - ROS running installed in Angstrom through the script https://github.com/vmayoral/beagle-ros/blob/master/ros-angstrom.sh
    - roscore running
    - ros installation working against an external master (rosnode list and rosnode ping)

 Issues:
    - It seems ROS nodes doesn't start properly. This is an issue previosly opened in the meta-ros project https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros/issues/68. I'm actively working to find a solution with the meta-ros guys https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros/issues/10  but it might take a while since this issue has been open for some time already.
    - catkin_make doesn't work. Neither it does going through the process manually http://www.ros.org/wiki/catkin/commands/catkin_make.

 Plans for the next week:
    - Adress the first issue. Try to make the ROS nodes start properly. Some debugging will be necessary.
    - Address catkin_make issue.
    - complete the rosping milestone
    - keep working in the roadmap planned (ROS tutorials for now).
